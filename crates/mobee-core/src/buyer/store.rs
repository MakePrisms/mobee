//! Opened only by the daemon (guaranteed single-owner by the home lock). This is
//! the state home the later phases build on — the reservation ledger, payment
//! attempts, and lifecycle tables all land here. Step 1 ships the minimal shell:
//! a `buyer_meta` schema-version row and a `jobs` stub table, in WAL mode with
//! foreign keys and `synchronous=FULL` so the money-adjacent state that follows
//! inherits crash-safe defaults from day one.
//!
//! `rusqlite`'s [`Connection`] is `Send` but not `Sync`; the store keeps it behind
//! a mutex and callers reach it from the async runtime via `spawn_blocking`.
