//! The buyer's **reservation ledger** — the in-flight commitment half of the buyer's
//! money accounting, layered on the daemon-owned state DB (`buyer.sqlite`).
//!
//! # The two-ceiling available model
//!
//! A reservation must fit under BOTH of two independent ceilings — one physical, one policy — so
//! `available` is their minimum:
//!
//! ```text
//! available = min( wallet_balance − reserved ,  total_cap − spent − reserved )
//!                  └─── wallet ceiling ───┘      └──── budget ceiling ─────┘
//! ```
//!
//! - `wallet_balance` — spendable ecash the wallet reports RIGHT NOW (passed in; the store never
//!   opens the wallet). A completed payment has ALREADY melted that ecash, so the live balance
//!   is net of every completed spend.
//! - `total_cap` — the policy budget cap ([`crate::budget::BudgetGate::total_cap`]); a spend limit
//!   independent of how much ecash is on hand.
//! - `spent` — the EXISTING budget ledger's spent total (`crate::budget`, folded from
//!   `spent.jsonl`); that crate is the ONLY spend authority. The reservation ledger never adds to
//!   `spent` — a `spent`-state row is a *label*, not a second spend.
//! - `reserved` — the sum of reservations still `Reserved` (in-flight). This is the new concept.
//!
//! ## Why the wallet ceiling does NOT subtract `spent`
//!
//! `spent` is cumulative over the buyer's whole life, but `wallet_balance` is a live snapshot that
//! already dropped by each completed melt. Subtracting `spent` from the wallet balance would
//! double-count every completed payment — once in the melt the wallet already reflects, and again
//! in the cumulative `spent` term — progressively refusing awards the buyer can actually afford as
//! spend history grows. The wallet ceiling is therefore `wallet_balance − reserved` only.
//!
//! ## Why the budget ceiling DOES subtract both `spent` and `reserved`
//!
//! `total_cap` is a fixed number that never moves, so the budget headroom must net out everything
//! already committed against it: cumulative `spent` plus still-in-flight `reserved`. In-flight
//! `reserved` therefore consumes BOTH ceilings — the funds are physically committed against the
//! wallet AND count against the budget until the job resolves.
//!
//! The two terms of the budget ceiling never double-count each other because a given amount is in
//! exactly ONE of `reserved`/`spent` at a time: `reserved` sums rows whose state is
//! [`ReservationState::Reserved`] and NOTHING else, and a collect that converts a reservation to
//! [`ReservationState::Spent`] moves the amount out of `reserved` at the same moment the budget
//! ledger's `spent` takes it up (see [`crate::buyer::store::BuyerStore::convert_to_spent`] for the
//! ordering obligation that keeps this handoff gapless). A [`ReservationState::Released`] row is
//! likewise excluded from `reserved`, so a release frees the funds under both ceilings and a
//! re-release can never free them a second time.
//!
//! Award **reserves** `max_sats` for a job and is refused if it exceeds `available`; a successful
//! collect **converts** the reservation `reserved → spent`; a job that can no longer be paid has
//! its reservation **released** so the funds become available again under both ceilings.
//!
//! # Atomicity
//!
//! Every mutation runs inside a single `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction (see
//! [`crate::buyer::store::BuyerStore`]), so the available-check and the reserve write are ONE
//! write-locked step: two concurrent awards can never both read a stale `reserved` and both slip
//! past the balance.
